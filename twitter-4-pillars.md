🏛️ Built Kratos MCP on the 4 Pillars Framework

After 30+ production apps, I discovered what makes AI truly useful:

1️⃣ PRD Engineering - Requirements as code
2️⃣ Prompt Engineering - Optimized AI interactions  
3️⃣ Context Engineering - Smart memory management
4️⃣ Memory Engineering - Persistent knowledge

## The Visual Post
```
The 4 Pillars of AI Development 🏛️

📋 PRD → Requirements become code
💬 Prompt → AI understands intent
🧠 Context → Right info, right time
💾 Memory → Never forget anything

Built Kratos MCP using this framework.

Your AI now remembers everything.

## The Problem/Solution
```
Most AI tools only focus on Prompt Engineering 💬

But you need ALL 4 Pillars:

🏛️ The 4 Pillars Framework:
• PRD Engineering 📋
• Prompt Engineering 💬  
• Context Engineering 🧠
• Memory Engineering 💾

Kratos MCP implements all 4.

That's why it works.

## The Breakdown
```
How I built an AI memory system that actually works:

🏛️ The 4 Pillars:

PRD 📋 → Your requirements stay consistent
Prompt 💬 → AI knows what you want
Context 🧠 → Only relevant info loaded
Memory 💾 → Everything persists

This framework changed everything.

## The One-Liner
```
🏛️ 4 Pillars of AI: PRD + Prompt + Context + Memory

Most tools have 1.
Some have 2.
None had all 4.

So I built Kratos MCP.

## The Story Version
```
Tried 10+ AI tools. All missing something.

Claude? No memory 💾
Copilot? No context 🧠
Others? No PRD structure 📋

Built Kratos on the 4 Pillars Framework:

PRD + Prompt + Context + Memory = 🏛️

Now my AI never forgets.

## The Technical
```
🏛️ The 4 Pillars Framework:

1. PRD Engineering 📋
   → Requirements.md in every project

2. Prompt Engineering 💬
   → Optimized system prompts

3. Context Engineering 🧠
   → Smart retrieval (95.8% accuracy)

4. Memory Engineering 💾
   → SQLite per project

= Kratos MCP

## The Challenge
```
Challenge: Name an AI tool with all 4 pillars 🏛️

☑️ PRD Engineering
☑️ Prompt Engineering  
☑️ Context Engineering
☑️ Memory Engineering

I'll wait...

That's why I built Kratos MCP.
